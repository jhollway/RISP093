## Most important lesson

.pull-left[![](https://cdn.imgbin.com/14/23/6/imgbin-people-connected-tXALjkJraJY0PjsUKek18tXrH.jpg)]

.pull-right[
- Most important takeaway: Always ask what a tie **means**

  - What does _“already knowing”_ mean?
  
  - How can we interpret different weights/ structures?

## Types of ties

.pull-left-1[
Actions
- talks to
- sleeps with
- sells to
- gives aid to

Cognitive-affective
- likes
- knows
- despises
- admires

Role-based
- kinship: brother of, daughter of
- social: friend of, competitor of
- organisational: boss of, teacher of

- network ties often seen as “plumbing” through which “stuff” flows
- stuff can be ideas, “capital”, etc
- micro questions about position, inequality, etc
- macro questions about network intervention, resilience, etc

- network ties also serve as informational “cues”
- cues can be to identity, preferences, etc
- micro questions about how local networks affect perception
- macro questions about emergent cultures from certain network topologies

## Networks and culture

.pull-left-1[![:scale 75%](https://pup-assets.imgix.net/onix/images/9780691137155.jpg)]

.pull-right-2[
- structure long linked with culture (e.g. Berger and Luckmann, Bourdieu, Douglas)

- 1970s “breakthrough” established social networks as method of structural analysis distinct from cultural analysis and Parsonian normative theory (Blau, White et al 1976)

- today tentative reconciliation in different directions:
  - ties affect culture (Erickson, Krackhardt, Kilduff, Carley, DiMaggio)
  - culture affects ties (symbolic interactionalism/ cultural sociology of Emirbayer and Goodwin, Lizardo, Daisy)
  - a duality understanding (White 1992, Breiger, Fuhse, Mische)

## Network theory

Model | Social Capital | Social Homogeneity
--------|---------|---------
  | (explaining success) | (explaining choice)
**Network flow model** | Capitalization | Contagion
(ties as pipes) | (e.g. weak ties) | (e.g. diffusion)
**Network coordination model** | Cooperation | Convergence
(ties as bonds) | (e.g. exchange) | (e.g. equivalence)

&gt; “Political actors are creative and resourceful
[...] the fields, arenas, or social spaces in which political contestation takes place are never unidimensional but contain multiple types of actors and relations.
Political actors turn to or create new categories of cooperation or contestation in their efforts to build resources or flank those with whom they disagree.” ~ Knoke et al (2021): 1.

## Ego networks

Usually .red[name generator], 
.red[name interpreter],
and sometimes .red[name interrelater].

+ can analyse larger networks (sampling)
+ compatible with traditional methods (and designs)
+ can study intersecting social circles (focal nodes)
]

.pull-right[
- demands traditional assumptions (power laws)
- missing structural data (brokerage)
- recall often biased toward longer-term interactions (Freeman, Romney, &amp; Freeman 1987)
- recall inaccurate when respondents report perceptions of relationships between third parties (McEvily 2014)
]

???

_Name generator_: ego (survey respondent) names important peers on one or more dimensions, e.g. ask for frequency of contact? valence?

_Name interpreter_: ego provides information about these peers (alters' attributes) and the ties that bind them (tie attributes)

_Name interrelater_: ego provides information about the potential ties among peers, e.g. how frequently do these two exchange information?

## Cognitive social structure

- Also known as a .red[CSS]
- Asks respondents to report on the structure of relations
of others in the network from their point of view
- Then the similarities and discrepancies between the network as reported by individuals in the network is analysed
- Or the impacts of perceived social structure on outcome is considered, e.g. perceived influence/ popularity
- See Krackhardt 1987; Knoke 1998; Knoke et al. 2019

## Whole networks

Respondents presented with a .red[roster] (complete list of individuals in population of interest; Marsden 1990)

+ reduces recall bias stemming from unreliably recalling interaction partners’ names
+ reduces perception bias cos reports cross-checked, or not even requested (though see Boda et al)

- only possible for small networks or networks where relational data publicly recorded
- larger rosters also become unreliable (Pustejovsky &amp; Spillane 2009)

some .red[seed nodes] recommend others, who recommend more, usw;
a non-probability sampling method that concentrates on most accessible part of the population

- cheap, simple, and cost-efficient
- easy way into hard-to-reach (small, covert) groups

But

- oversamples most public and well connected (more often
seeds and lie on more recruitment paths) and may miss isolated/weakly connected individuals/groups
- biases towards particular network structures (like high degree) and not representative

Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) aims to mitigate some of these concerns by weighting the sample to compensate for non-random recruitment patterns
