## Seven Bridges of Königsberg

- Became a wealthy port set around two islands on the Pregel River

- Citizens spent Sunday afternoons walking its seven bridges

- They devised a puzzle about how to cross all seven bridges only once in a single walk...

- Reply to mayor of Danzig:
  - “. . . I do not understand why you expect a mathematician to produce [a solution...], for the solution is based on reason alone, and its discovery .red[does not depend on any math]ematical principle.”

- Yet, later that year he admitted to an Italian mathematician:
  - “This question is so banal, but seemed to me worthy of attention in that .red[[neither] geometry, nor algebra, nor even the art of counting was sufficient] to solve it.”

- He saw the problem related to what Leibniz called .red[geometria situs], or the geometry of position...

## Bad for Königsberg, Great for graph theory

.center[![:scale 55%](https://divisbyzero.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/konigsberggraph.jpg)
]

- In 1735, Euler founded .red[graph theory] by proving no solution to the problem

- Proof consisted of two steps:
  - First, route inside each land mass irrelevant, only the connections,
  meaning he could *abstract* to a graph of .red[nodes] connected by .red[ties]
  - Second, in unique path no more than 2 nodes should have an odd .red[degree] (#ties) --
  if enter, also need to leave, so intermediate nodes must be even
  - Since all nodes had odd degrees, no way of solving the problem

Social networks concerns the abstraction, theorising, and analysis of relations into structures.

Relations can be key to understanding (changes in)

- macro-structures or micro-structures
- the distribution of attributes within those structures
- or even what those structures consist of

_Name generator_: ego (survey respondent) names important peers on one or more dimensions, e.g. ask for frequency of contact? valence?

_Name interpreter_: ego provides information about these peers (alters' attributes) and the ties that bind them (tie attributes)

_Name interrelater_: ego provides information about the potential ties among peers, e.g. how frequently do these two exchange information?

- Asks respondents to report on the structure of relations
of others in the network from their point of view
- Then the similarities and discrepancies between the network as reported by individuals in the network is analysed
- Or the impacts of perceived social structure on outcome is considered, e.g. perceived influence/ popularity

some .red[seed nodes] recommend others, who recommend more, usw;
a non-probability sampling method that concentrates on most accessible part of the population

- cheap, simple, and cost-efficient
- easy way into hard-to-reach (small, covert) groups

But

- oversamples most public and well connected (more often
seeds and lie on more recruitment paths) and may miss isolated/weakly connected individuals/groups
- biases towards particular network structures (like high degree) and not representative

Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) aims to mitigate some of these concerns by weighting the sample to compensate for non-random recruitment patterns

## Missing data

- Unfortunately, even a small fraction of missing observations could significantly bias network structure

  - A single non-response in a large survey is `\(1\)` missing observation

  - A single non-response in networks is `\(n-1\)` missing observations
  
  - And what do you do with ties with missing targets?

  - Moreover, often not missing at random...

## Demanding data

.pull-left[
- Networks is demanding of data
  - But true of all attempts at providing persuasive evidence for causality

- Where data comes from is crucial because:
  - how meaningful your descriptive or inferential conclusions depends on tie-data being meaningful

- So, with an eye to your final report, think about where you might get as meaningful, complete, whole-network data, ideally over time (as granular as possible) and with plenty of additional data on other ties and other attributes...

- No big deal, right?

&gt; “Political actors are creative and resourceful
[...] the fields, arenas, or social spaces in which political contestation takes place are never unidimensional but contain multiple types of actors and relations.
Political actors turn to or create new categories of cooperation or contestation in their efforts to build resources or flank those with whom they disagree.” 

&gt; ~ Knoke et al (2021): 1.

## Social Networks

**Assumption**: social life is associative, and relations are meaningful

**Premise**: how social entities are connected matters

**Argument**: more interdependent and contextual than traditional quantitative or qualitative work
  - By taking context and dependencies into account, even making them central to the explanation,
  networks goes beyond traditional statistics
  - By using graph theoretic concepts and formal measures, even scaling them to large settings,
  networks goes beyond traditional case studies

**Promise**: to help understand social, relational life

### Don’t “do networks” to

- join .red[hot research area] (though it is)
- present .red[fancy pictures] (seldom enough)
- present .red[fancy analysis] (depends on data quality)
- .red[explain more variance] (not simply an add-on)
- .red[explain everything] (empirical settings are messy)
- use .red[big data] (RQ and theory relationship required)
- use .red[networks expertise] (clear motivation required)

### Do “do networks” to

- .red[describe social structures], both local and global
- .red[identify individuals] in specal positions
