- cohesion and community (this week)

]

---
## Measures of cohesion

### Density

- Basically `#` ties over `#` possible ties
  - Ranges between 0 and 1
  - Tends to be low in social networks
  - Tends to be lower in large networks

.pull-left[
- _How does the numerator or denominator change for directed networks?_

  - _for undirected networks?_

  - _for two-mode networks?_
]
  
--

.pull-right[
`$$D_d = \frac{|E|}{|V|(|V|-1)}$$`

`$$D_u = \frac{2|E|}{|V|(|V|-1)}$$`

`$$D_{2M} = \frac{|E|}{|V||W|}$$`
]

---
### Reciprocity

- Two methods of calculation
  - Dyad method (`mode = ratio`)
     - `#` reciprocated dyads / `#` connected dyads
  - Arc method (`mode = default`) 
     - `#` reciprocated arcs / `#` arcs

- Ranges between 0 and 1
  - Asymmetric ties thought to be unstable (or hierarchical), so equilibrium of null or reciprocated dyads
  - Tends to be high in _social_ networks
  - Multiplex reciprocity suggests _exchange_

---
#### Georg Simmel

.pull-left[![:scale 75%](https://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/image/simmel.jpg)]

.pull-right[
- Born 1 March 1858, Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia
  - Bourgeois elite
  - Academic outsider
  
- Died 28 September 1918, Strassburg, German Empire

- “Quantitative Aspects of the Group”
]

---
#### Dyads and Triads

.pull-left[
.red[Dyad] = 2 person .red[clique] (completely connected subgroup)
- _Safety_: easier to exert control through application of power asymmetries
- _Effectance_: no other person to shift balance of the group, therefore each able to retain their individuality
]

.pull-right[
.red[Triad] = 3 person .red[clique]
- _Safety_: possibility of a dyad forming within the triad, threatening exclusion of individual unless they subordinate to group norms
- _Effectance_: harder to exert individual control, feels more impersonal and distant, anomie
]

Of course, Hollywood reads social networks studies.

That's why you see so many love triangles.

Cos then strategies like competition, alliances, mediation, etc
come into play...
]

---
### Triplets/Transitivity

- “friend of my friend is my friend”
  
- For undirected networks, really just proportion of connected .red[triplets] that are “closed”
  - i.e. when A—B, and B—C, then A—C
  - various causal arguments, including opportunity for introduction...
- For directed networks, possible to distinguish:
  - .red[transitivity]: When `\(A\rightarrow B\)`, and `\(B\rightarrow C\)`, then `\(A\rightarrow C\)`
  - .red[three-cycles]: When `\(A\rightarrow B\)`, and `\(B\rightarrow C\)`, then `\(C\rightarrow A\)`
  - supposedly transitivity indicative of hierarchy and three-cycles contraindicative,
  but see also Block (2015)

- Ranges between 0 (no closure) to 1 (fully closed/transitive graph)
  - Social networks typically between 0.3 and 0.6

_What’s next?_

---
### Projection

- Recall a two-mode network, one with two sets of nodes
  - _Q: Is a two-mode network the same as a bipartite network?_

- .red[Projection] is the construction of 1-2 one-mode networks from a two-
mode network
  - When you are interested in influence across one type of nodes through joint or shared relationships to another type of nodes

- Most multimodal data projected and analysed with network analytic tools constructed for 1-mode networks
  - Assumption, sometimes warranted, is that the analytic purchase gained is worth the loss of some information

--

- To project a two mode network, multiply incidence matrix with its transpose
  - if `\(X = pg\)`, then `\(XX^T = P\)`, where `\(P = pp\)`
  - if `\(X = pg\)`, then `\(X^TX = G\)`, where `\(G = gg\)`
- Or use `migraph::project_rows()` or `migraph::project_cols()`

.pull-left[
#### Problems with projection

&lt;img src="ISON_L4_Community_files/figure-html/projprob-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

--

.pull-right[
1. projecting entails loss of:
  - .red[identity information] on one of two node sets, e.g. which blue nodes the green nodes shared
  - .red[structural information], e.g. whether triangle in the projection through multilateral or bilateral relationships (Hollway and Koskinen 2016)

2. projecting can bias network configurations:
  - high levels of triangles (Opsahl 2011), affecting other measures such as clustering coefficients (Opsahl 2013) and structural holes (Burt 1998)
  - degree, radial and medial centralities can also be sensitive to projection

3. projecting frustrates interpretation:
  - obscures choices behind the tie (Hollway 2015), e.g. tie from others’ decisions to tie to shared node (Wang et al 2016)
  - joint or co-memberships often not so meaningful (Paterson 2019)
]

---
### 4-Cycles

- Analogue of triadic closure for two-mode networks
- Number of four-cycles over number of at least three paths
- The index ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is a fully cohesive graph

- what about different types of four-cycles?
  - shared vs congruent
  - is it really a cycle?

## How many ‘groups’ in this network?



.pull-left[
&lt;img src="ISON_L4_Community_files/figure-html/plotting-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- weak vs strong components
  - 2 (weak) components
  - 3 (strong) components

- more ‘clusters’ here?
]

---
## Two strategies

.pull-left[
### Faction analysis

- .red[deductive]: predetermine number of subgroups
- algorithm tries to maximise density within subgroups by permuting observed matrix
- compare to perfectly maximised ideal type
]

.pull-right[
### Community detection

- .red[inductive]: identify an appropriate number and membership of groups from observed network
- try to maximise “modularity” criterion
- by undertaking a certain method...
]

---
## What are communities?

.center[![:scale 25%](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/23/8577/F1.large.jpg)]

- Communities are densely connected (+ within-group), and well-separated (- between-group)
- Includes info about internal structure (like cliques) and external structure (like components)
- They define and affect groups, networks, and individuals

---
### Examples

&lt;img src="ISON_L4_Community_files/figure-html/commegs-1.png" width="1152" /&gt;

???

- semantic mappings
- neurological mappings

---
## Modularity

.pull-left[

.center[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Network_Community_Structure.svg/220px-Network_Community_Structure.svg.png)]

`$$Q = \sum_{c=1}^k (e_{cc} - a_c^2)$$`

- Simplified expression (see
Fortunato 2010: 89) for the .red[modularity criterion] `\(Q\)`, where:
  - `\(e_{cc}\)` is % edges within a cluster `\(c\)`
  - `\(a_c^2\)` is the expected % of ties within the cluster in a random graph with the same degrees

]

.pull-right[

- Always &lt; 1 but can be negative
  - 0 when whole graph is taken as a single community, i.e. edges randomly distributed 
  - Negative modularity means less community structure than random, e.g. multipartite structure
  
- Modularity grows larger if better separated groups or graph gets larger, 
so do not use to compare graphs of different sizes...

- Partitioning graphs into `\(c\)` components .red[NP-hard] (computationally difficult) problem
  - Finding optimal solution not always possible
  - Need an .red[algorithm] (a set of rules) by which we can identify community memberships until we find the allocation that maximises `\(Q\)`
]

---
## Data and Algorithms

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="ISON_L4_Community_files/figure-html/karate-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- Random
  - Label assignment e.g. .red[Kernighan-Lin]
  - Walks e.g. .red[Walktrap]
  
- Divisive
  - Hierarchical decomposition e.g. .red[Edge-Betweenness]
  
- Agglomerative
  - Hierarchical composition e.g. .red[Fast-Greedy]
]
  
---
.pull-left[
### Kernighan-Lin algorithm

&lt;img src="ISON_L4_Community_files/figure-html/klc-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
Intuition: swap group label assignment
1. Start: full network with random (usually two) group assignment
2. Identify: node-group-switch would increase `\(Q\)` the most
3. Modify: that node’s group assignment
4. Repeat: steps 2-3
5. Stop: when no switch increases `\(Q\)`

.pull-left[
Pros
- Quick and easy
- Similar to faction analysis
]

.pull-right[
Cons
- Depends on initial distribution
- Requires predetermined number of communities
- Does not always find the best solution
]
]

---
.pull-left[
### Edge-betweenness algorithm

&lt;img src="ISON_L4_Community_files/figure-html/ebc-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
Intuition: full start and divide
1. Start: with full network and a single community
2. Identify: edge with highest edge-betweenness (bridge)
3. Modify: delete that edge and identify any resulting components as a community
4. Repeat: steps 2-3
5. Stop: when no better `\(Q\)` is obtained by any edge deletion

.pull-left[
Pros
- Clear logic based on information propagation
- No random variation
]

.pull-right[
Cons
- Does not necessarily maximise modularity
- Calculation of edge betweenness slow
- Does not always find the best solution
]
]

---
.pull-left[
### Fast-greedy algorithm

&lt;img src="ISON_L4_Community_files/figure-html/fgc-1.png" width="504" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
Intuition: empty start and agglomerate
1. Start: empty graph and each node its own community
2. Identify: evaluate which merger of two adjacent nodes would increase `\(Q\)` the most
3. Modify: assign same community to all merged nodes
4. Repeat: steps 2-3
5. Stop: when merging decreases `\(Q\)`

.pull-left[
Pros
- Quick and possible to use on larger graphs
- Gives a dendrogram of the hierarchical clustering
- Most fun to watch at work
]

.pull-right[
Cons
- Not good at detecting smaller communities, tends to quickly form larger communities

## Resolution limits

.pull-left[
![](http://www.traag.net/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/res-limit-free.png)
]

.pull-right[
- Possibility of
  - breaking up large communities
  - missing smaller communities

- May depend on network size
  - Larger the network, more likely that modularity increased while ignoring smaller communities
  - Called a .red[resolution limit] and is a _problem_
]

---
## Community detection summary

- Difficult to find the “right” answer
  - Many possible, sensible approaches, but hard to know what will be best for your purpose
  
- A weakness is that many tools lack rigorous theoretical underpinnings
  - A fun line of research, because anything that works is a valid solution
